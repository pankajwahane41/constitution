        "D": "Economic equality in wealth distribution"
      },
      "correct": "A",
      "explanation": "Article 14 guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws to all persons within the territory of India. The landmark case of State of West Bengal v. Anwar Ali Sarkar (1952) established that this article applies to all persons, not just citizens. The Supreme Court in this case held that the West Bengal Special Courts Act conferred arbitrary powers for classification without clear guidelines, violating the principle of equal protection of law.",

        "D": "Indra Sawhney v. Union of India"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "The 'classification test' was established by Justice Tendolkar in Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Justice Tendolkar (1958). This test permits differential classification of subjects by the State, provided it is founded on 'intelligible differentia' (objects within the class are clearly distinguishable from those outside) and has a 'rational nexus' with the objective sought to be achieved by the classification.",

      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "The 'arbitrariness test' was established by Justice Bhagwati in E.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu (1974). This case introduced the doctrine that Article 14 includes a guarantee against arbitrariness in State action. This test has been frequently used to declare State actions ultra vires Article 14, ensuring that government actions must be rational and non-arbitrary.",

      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "The 'triumvirate' test was established in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978). A seven-Judge Bench considered the relationship between Articles 14, 19, and 21, establishing that any law interfering with personal liberty must satisfy a triple test: (1) prescribe a procedure, (2) withstand Article 19's fundamental rights, and (3) be tested against Article 14. The procedure must be right, just, fair, non-arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive.",

        "D": "Only economic backwardness can be a ground for reservation"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "In Indra Sawhney v. Union of India (1993), the Supreme Court held that Article 16(1) is a facet of Article 14. Both articles permit reasonable classification, which may include reservation. The primary aim of both Article 14 and 16 is equality and equality of opportunity, and Article 16(4) is a means to achieve this. The court established that reservations should not exceed 50% and identified the 'creamy layer' concept to exclude advanced sections from reservations.",

      "correct": "A",
      "explanation": "In Shayara Bano v. Union of India (2017), a 5-Judge Bench declared instantaneous triple talaq (Talaq-ul-biddat) unconstitutional. The court stated that the fundamental right to equality under Article 14 encompasses gender equality, equity, and justice. Conferring social status based on patriarchal values or male mercy is incompatible with the letter and spirit of Articles 14 and 15.",

      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "In National Legal Service Authority (NALSA) v. Union of India (2014), the Supreme Court held that the right to equality under Article 14 is framed in gender-neutral terms ('all persons') and thus extends to transgender persons. This case recognized the rights of the third gender to equality and protection against discrimination, ensuring that the Constitution protects all persons regardless of their gender identity.",

        "D": "Shayara Bano v. Union of India"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "In Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India (2018), a five-judge Bench considered the constitutionality of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, specifically concerning same-sex relations between consenting adults. The Bench unanimously struck down Section 377 IPC to the extent it criminalized consensual same-sex relations, holding it violative of the right to equality under Article 14, which equally applies to same-sex couples.",

      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "In Joseph Shine v. Union of India (2018), a five-judge Bench examined the constitutionality of Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code (adultery) and Section 198 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The Bench unanimously struck down Section 497 IPC, thereby decriminalizing adultery, on grounds that it violates Articles 14, 15, and 21. The court declared it an archaic and paternalistic law infringing upon a woman's autonomy and dignity.",

      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "In Indian Young Lawyers' Association v. State of Kerala (2018), the Supreme Court by a 4:1 majority declared the Sabarimala Temple's custom prohibiting women of 'menstruating years' from entering the temple premises unconstitutional. The decision was based on equality principles under Article 14, emphasizing that constitutional rights cannot be superseded by religious customs that violate gender equality.",

      "correct": "A",
      "explanation": "In Air India v. Nargesh Meerza (1978), the Supreme Court struck down Air India's rules for female flight attendants which required retirement upon reaching 35 years of age, marriage, or first pregnancy - rules not applicable to male attendants. The Court held these rules constituted official arbitrariness and hostile discrimination, violating Article 14's guarantee of equality.",

        "D": "Harsh Mander v. Union of India"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "In Visakha v. State of Rajasthan (1997), the Supreme Court held that sexual harassment violates women's fundamental right to gender equality under Article 14 and the right to life under Article 21. Even without an express constitutional provision, the right against sexual harassment at the workplace is implicit in these fundamental rights. The court established guidelines for prevention of sexual harassment, which later formed the basis for the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act.",

      },
      "correct": "C",
      "explanation": "In Harsh Mander v. Union of India (2018), the Delhi High Court decriminalized begging by challenging the Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959, which criminalized various forms of begging. The court stated that begging is not a disease and criminalizing it is a direct attack on the fundamental rights of the poorest to access basic necessities like food and shelter, violating Article 14's guarantee of equality.",

      },
      "correct": "C",
      "explanation": "Article 15(3) explicitly states that 'Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any special provision for women and children.' This clause enables the State to enact gender-specific laws and policies, such as reserved seats for women in local bodies, maternity benefits, and other protective legislation that would otherwise appear to discriminate on the basis of sex.",

      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "Article 16 specifically deals with 'Equality of opportunity in matters of public employment.' Article 16(4) allows the State to make provision for reservation of appointments or posts in favor of any backward class of citizens which, in the opinion of the State, is not adequately represented in the services under the State. This is the constitutional basis for reservations in government jobs and promotions.",

      "explanation": "Article 17 states that 'Untouchability' is abolished and its practice in any form is forbidden. The enforcement of any disability arising out of 'Untouchability' shall be an offence punishable in accordance with law. This article makes untouchability a punishable offense and aims to eliminate the social evil that has been prevalent in Indian society for centuries.",

      "correct": "C",
      "explanation": "Article 18(1) states that 'No title, not being a military or academic distinction, shall be conferred by the State.'

The use of 'person' makes Article 14 comprehensive and ensures protection to all individuals within India's jurisdiction.",
