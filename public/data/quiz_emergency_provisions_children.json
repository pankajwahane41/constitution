      "question": "Imagine a huge storm is coming toward your town. Everyone needs to work together quickly to stay safe. Some normal rules might need to change temporarily - like allowing emergency vehicles to drive anywhere, or opening schools as shelters. Once the storm passes, everything goes back to normal. How is this like a National Emergency?",
