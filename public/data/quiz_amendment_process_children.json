      "question": "Your school made rules 70 years ago when there were no computers or internet. Now students need rules about online learning and cyber safety. The core values (respect, learning, safety) stay the same, but some specific rules need updating. How is this like constitutional amendments?",

      "child_friendly_analogy": "Like how your family might update house rules for new technology, but the core family values of love, respect, and care never change."

      "child_friendly_analogy": "Like how any student in the student council can suggest changes to school rules, any elected representative in Parliament can suggest constitutional changes."

      "category": "Amendment Types",
      "question": "All constitutional amendments require the same voting process in Parliament.",
      "answer": false,
      "explanation": "No! There are different types of amendments requiring different procedures - some need simple majority, others need special majority (2/3 of present members + majority of total membership), and some also need state approval!",
      "child_friendly_analogy": "Like how different school rule changes need different approval levels - minor changes might need just teacher approval, but major changes need principal and parent approval too."

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Two-thirds of present members AND majority of total membership",
      "explanation": "Special majority ensures that constitutional changes have broad support, not just from whoever happens to be present that day. This prevents hasty changes and ensures democratic consensus!",
      "child_friendly_analogy": "Like how for important class decisions, you need most of the class to agree AND most of the students who are actually present - this prevents small groups from making big changes when others aren't around."

      ],
      "correct_answer": "At least half the state legislatures must also approve the change",
      "explanation": "Changes affecting federalism (center-state relations) need approval from at least half the states. This ensures states have a say in changes that affect their powers!",

      "answer": true,
      "explanation": "Yes! In the famous Kesavananda Bharati case (1973), the Supreme Court established that it can review amendments to ensure they don't destroy the Constitution's basic structure. This protects democracy from being dismantled!",

        "The Supreme Court would likely strike it down for violating Basic Structure", 
        "Nothing - amendments cannot be challenged"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "The Supreme Court would likely strike it down for violating Basic Structure",
      "explanation": "Such an amendment would destroy democracy, which is a basic structural feature. The Supreme Court would likely declare it unconstitutional and void, protecting the democratic system!",
      "child_friendly_analogy": "Like how a teacher would stop students from changing class rules to 'No more learning, only play time forever' because it goes against the basic purpose of school."
