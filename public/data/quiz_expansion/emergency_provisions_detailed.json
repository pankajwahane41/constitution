# Blueprint for 75 Child-Friendly Quiz Questions on India's Emergency Provisions (Articles 352, 356, 360)

## Orientation: Purpose, Scope, and Narrative Arc

This report provides a complete, child-friendly blueprint to create 75 quiz questions on India’s emergency provisions—National Emergency (Article 352), President’s Rule (Article 356), and Financial Emergency (Article 360)—with a strong emphasis on the constitutional text and parliamentary oversight. The questions will use simple analogies from weather alerts, safety protocols, family emergency plans, school drills, and protective shields to help young learners grasp complex constitutional mechanisms without losing accuracy.

The narrative follows a careful sequence: what (definitions and concepts), how (processes and safeguards), and so what (oversight, accountability, and responsible use). The blueprint is anchored in Part XVIII of the Constitution of India and aligned with reputable summaries to ensure fidelity to the original rules and intent.[^1] The quiz design is structurally consistent with the comparative framework presented in the educational content, enabling educators to use the questions as comprehension checks, scenario-based practice, and civics outreach.

### Learning Objectives

Children will be able to:
- Distinguish National, State, and Financial emergencies by their triggers, decision-makers, area affected, initial duration, continuance, and oversight.
- Explain parliamentary control mechanisms (laying, special majority, time-bound renewals, and revocation/disapproval procedures).
- Recall which rights may be limited during a National Emergency and which remain in force (Articles 20 and 21).
- Connect key historical events of the 1975–77 Emergency to safeguards introduced by the 44th Amendment.
- Use simple analogies to reason about oversight and accountability in emergencies.

The learning objectives and question mapping align closely with the comparative tables and oversight maps in the educational content, which summarize decisions, laying, approvals, time limits, and revocation pathways.[^1][^3][^4][^6][^7][^10]
