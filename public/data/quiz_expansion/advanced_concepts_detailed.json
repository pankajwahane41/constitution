The union's charter states that these standards constitute 'the law of the organization' and take precedence over local laws when conflicts arise.

However, the hospital's spiritual care department has established a policy that chaplains must remain neutral about theological differences and focus on providing emotional and spiritual support rather than proselytizing. Some religious groups argue this policy silences their voice, while others appreciate the inclusive approach.
