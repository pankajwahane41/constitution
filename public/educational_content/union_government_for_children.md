# How India’s Union Government Works: A Child-Friendly Guide

## 1. Introduction: Democracy as a Team Game

Imagine a school where students, teachers, and the principal work together to make fair rules and keep the playground safe. In India’s democracy, the whole country is like that school. Citizens are the students, elected representatives are the class monitors and captains, and the Union Government is the group that makes and follows rules for the entire school of India.

India is a democratic republic. That means people choose their leaders, and those leaders work together to make laws, run the country, and solve problems. The main parts of the Union Government are:

- The President (the Head of State)
- The Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers (the Head of Government and the team that runs day-to-day work)
- The Parliament (where laws are made; it includes the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha)

In this guide, we will meet each part, see how they are chosen, understand what they do, and learn how they cooperate—like classmates, team captains, and a principal working together to keep the school running smoothly.[^6]

## 2. A Simple Picture: How the Union Government Fits Together

Think of the Union Government as three teams on the same side:

- The President: Like the principal of the school. The principal gives recognition and makes sure the rules are followed.
- The Parliament: Like the student council and the class meetings where rules are discussed, improved, and agreed upon.
- The Prime Minister and Council of Ministers: Like the head boy or head girl and the class monitors who run daily activities based on what the student council has decided.

To make this concrete, Table 1 uses a school analogy to show each institution’s role. After the table, we explain why teamwork is so important.

Table 1. School Analogy Map: Institution to Child-Friendly Analogy and Role

| Institution                 | Child-Friendly Analogy      | Simple Explanation of Role                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| President of India         | Principal                   | Head of State; gives recognition to decisions and ensures rules are followed               |
| Parliament (Lok Sabha + Rajya Sabha) | Student council and class meetings | Where laws are proposed, debated, and passed                                               |
| Prime Minister             | Head boy/head girl          | Leads the government team and coordinates work                                             |
| Council of Ministers       | Class monitors and subject captains | Carry out day-to-day work, implement laws, and run ministries                              |

Why teamwork matters: In a democracy, no single part can do everything. The government proposes ideas, Parliament debates and changes them, and the President gives recognition. If they cooperate, good decisions reach the playground (our country) quickly and fairly.[^1][^2][^6]

## 3. Meet the President: India’s Head of State

Who is the President? The President is the first citizen of India and the Head of State. The official residence is Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi. The President’s role is to give recognition to government decisions, keep the system running smoothly, and uphold the Constitution.[^3][^4]

How is the President chosen? The President is elected by an electoral college. This is like a special election where not everyone votes directly. Instead, the people who vote are: elected Members of Parliament (MPs) from both houses of Parliament and elected representatives from the state legislative assemblies (and from the union territories of Delhi and Puducherry). The voting uses a method called proportional representation with a single transferable vote (PR-STV), and the President serves a five-year term and can be re-elected.[^3][^1]

What does the President do? The President exercises powers with the advice of the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers. These powers include:

- Executive actions: Appointing the Prime Minister and, on the Prime Minister’s advice, other ministers; appointing top officials like the Attorney General, Election Commissioners, and Governors.
- Legislative powers: Summoning and proroguing Parliament, addressing the nation through Parliament, sending back bills for reconsideration, and summoning joint sittings if the two houses disagree.
- Financial powers: Controlling the Contingency Fund of India and receiving recommendations before money bills are introduced.
- Judicial powers: Appointing judges and granting pardons or commuting sentences in certain cases.
- Diplomatic and military roles: Representing India internationally and serving as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces.
- Emergency powers: Proclaiming national, state, or financial emergencies in consultation with the government and Parliament, as defined by the Constitution.[^1][^2][^3]

To help remember the many roles, Table 2 lists the main categories of presidential powers with kid-friendly examples.

Table 2. President’s Powers: Category and Kid-Friendly Example

| Power Category  | What It Means in Practice                                                                    | Kid-Friendly Example                                              |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Executive       | Appoints the PM and ministers; appoints key officers                                         | Like the principal officially appointing the head girl/boy        |
| Legislative     | Summons Parliament, addresses the nation, can send bills back, calls joint sittings           | Calls a class meeting; can ask students to discuss a rule again   |
| Financial       | Controls national emergency funds; money bills need the President’s recommendations          | Ensures the school’s funds are used only with proper approval     |
| Judicial        | Appoints judges; can grant pardons or reduce punishments in certain cases                    | Can give a second chance or reduce detention after fair review    |
| Diplomatic      | Represents India in treaties and international forums                                         | The principal stands for the school at inter-school events        |
| Military        | Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces; appoints service chiefs                                | The principal is the chief protector of the school                |
| Emergency       | Can proclaim national, state, or financial emergencies as per the Constitution               | Calls a special assembly to handle a school-wide situation        |

The President’s Day-to-Day: In simple terms, the President says “yes” to decisions made by the government and Parliament, and ensures everything follows the rulebook (the Constitution). The real day-to-day governing is done by the Prime Minister and the ministers, but the President’s recognition makes those decisions official.[^1][^3]

## 4. Meet the Parliament: Where Laws Are Made

What is Parliament? Parliament is the Union Legislature. It includes the President, the Council of States (Rajya Sabha), and the House of the People (Lok Sabha). Parliament’s main jobs are to make laws, oversee administration, pass the Budget, and discuss national issues. Both houses must meet at least once every six months.[^2]

How are members chosen? The Lok Sabha is elected directly by the people (adult suffrage), while the Rajya Sabha is elected indirectly by elected members of state legislative assemblies (and as prescribed by law for union territories). The President also nominates a small number of members to the Rajya Sabha. A few historical notes: previously, the President could nominate Anglo-Indian members to the Lok Sabha, but this practice is no longer used. Current membership reflects the latest updated figures.[^2][^10][^8]

How long do they serve? The Lok Sabha is elected for a term of five years, unless it is dissolved earlier. In special emergencies, its term can be extended by law for up to one year at a time, and for no more than six months after the emergency ends. The Rajya Sabha is a continuing house—it is not dissolved—but one-third of its members retire every two years and are replaced by newly elected or nominated members.[^2]

Money Bills: Who Decides? When it comes to money bills ( laws about taxes and spending), the will of the Lok Sabha prevails. The Rajya Sabha can discuss and suggest changes, but the Lok Sabha has the final say. This reflects the principle that the house directly elected by the people should have the decisive voice on money matters.[^2]

The Speaker and Deputy Speaker: The Lok Sabha elects its Speaker and Deputy Speaker to conduct business and maintain order. The Rajya Sabha has a Chair and Deputy Chair for the same purpose.[^2]

Joint Sittings: If the two houses disagree on a bill, the President can summon a joint sitting of both houses to discuss and decide together. This helps resolve deadlocks so that important laws can move forward.[^2]

To compare the two houses at a glance, Table 3 shows how they differ in election, term, age qualification, maximum strength, and special features. After the table, we explain why the differences matter.

Table 3. Lok Sabha vs Rajya Sabha (Quick Comparison)

| Feature                | Lok Sabha (House of the People)                              | Rajya Sabha (Council of States)                                        |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| How members are chosen | Direct election by adult suffrage                             | Indirect election by state assembly members; few nominated by President |
| Term                   | Five years (can be dissolved earlier; term may extend during emergency by law) | Not dissolved; one-third retire every two years                         |
| Minimum age            | At least 25 years                                             | At least 30 years                                                       |
| Maximum strength       | Up to 552 (as per constitutional provisions)                  | Up to 250 (12 nominated by President; rest elected)                     |
| Special features       | Money bills’ will prevails; directly represents the people     | Represents states and UT interests; reviews and rechecks laws           |
| Historical note        | President could nominate Anglo-Indian members (no longer used) | President nominates 12 members with special knowledge or experience     |

What They Do Each Day: Members of Parliament (MPs) propose new laws (bills), debate their benefits and risks, improve them through committees, and then vote to pass them. They also question the government about its plans and spending (this is called oversight), discuss the national budget, and raise important public issues so solutions can be found.[^2]

## 5. The Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers: Leading the Government

Who is the Prime Minister? The Prime Minister is the head of the Council of Ministers and the chief link between the President and the government. The President appoints the Prime Minister, who is usually the leader of the party or coalition with the majority in the Lok Sabha.[^1][^7][^6]

How are ministers chosen? On the Prime Minister’s advice, the President appoints other ministers. Ministers must be members of Parliament within six months of joining the government (either elected to either house or elected to a state legislature within that period). The Council of Ministers includes Cabinet Ministers, Ministers of State (with independent charge), Ministers of State, and Deputy Ministers.[^1][^6]

What do the PM and ministers do? The Prime Minister coordinates the work of all ministries, leads meetings to set priorities, and communicates key decisions to the President. Ministers run their ministries day to day: preparing schemes, drafting bills, and implementing laws. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha, meaning they must enjoy the confidence of the elected house.[^1][^2][^7]

Table 4 explains the roles using simple examples.

Table 4. PM and Council of Ministers: Role and Simple Example

| Role                                | What It Means                                                                 | Simple Example                                                        |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Prime Minister                      | Leads the government team and coordinates decisions                           | Head girl/boy making sure class projects finish on time               |
| Cabinet Ministers                   | Head key ministries; take major decisions                                     | Subject captains leading science or math groups                       |
| Ministers of State (Independent charge) | Look after specific departments with autonomy                                 | A monitor running the art club independently                          |
| Ministers of State                  | Support Cabinet ministers                                                     | Assistant monitors helping the subject captain                        |
| Deputy Ministers                    | Help ministers with specific tasks                                            | Class helpers fetching materials, organizing events                   |
| Collective responsibility           | Government must retain Lok Sabha’s confidence                                | The class must keep the teacher’s trust to keep the project going     |

A Day in the Life of the Government: Ministers meet to decide priorities, propose new laws or improvements, and ensure schemes reach people. The Prime Minister chairs meetings, assigns work, and shares updates with the President. In Parliament, ministers answer questions, explain policies, and defend the government’s record.[^1][^2]

## 6. How They Work Together: Decision-Making in a Parliament

Good decisions travel a clear path:

1. Idea: A minister or an MP has an idea to solve a problem.
2. Draft: The ministry prepares a bill (a proposed law).
3. Discussion: The bill is introduced in Parliament, debated, and improved.
4. Vote: Both houses vote; for money bills, the Lok Sabha has the final say.
5. Assent: The President gives assent, making the bill a law.
6. Implementation: The Council of Ministers runs the programs and reports back to Parliament.[^2][^1]

Checks and balances help India’s system run fairly. If the two houses disagree, a joint sitting can be called. The President can send bills back for reconsideration. Parliament holds the government accountable through questions, debates, and approvals. Table 5 summarizes the lawmaking journey.

Table 5. Lawmaking Journey: Step, Who Does It, and What It Means

| Step         | Who Is Involved                              | What Happens                                                                   |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Idea         | Minister or MP                                | Identifies a problem and proposes a solution                                  |
| Draft        | Ministry with legal experts                   | Writes a bill with details and definitions                                    |
| Debate       | MPs in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha              | Discusses, amends, and improves the bill                                      |
| Vote         | Both houses; Lok Sabha decisive on money bills | MPs vote to accept or reject the bill                                         |
| Assent       | President                                     | Signs the bill; it becomes a law                                              |
| Implementation | Council of Ministers                          | Runs the program, spends the budget, and reports back to Parliament           |

Why This Matters: The step-by-step process ensures many eyes review each decision, reducing mistakes and making sure different views are heard.[^2]

## 7. Elections and Appointments: Who Chooses Whom?

Elections and appointments connect citizens to their representatives and those representatives to the highest offices. Table 6 offers a simple overview.

Table 6. Who Chooses Whom: Selection Overview

| Position                         | Who Chooses/How Selected                                                      | Term Length                                 | Where It Is Defined/Explained           |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| President                        | Electoral college: MPs + elected state assembly members (PR-STV)             | 5 years; eligible for re-election           | Government portal and constitutional references[^1][^3] |
| Lok Sabha MPs                    | Citizens (direct election; adult suffrage)                                    | 5 years (may be extended during emergency by law) | Parliament facts and structure[^2][^9][^10]     |
| Rajya Sabha MPs                  | Elected by state assembly members; 12 nominated by President                 | Rotating: one-third retire every two years  | Parliament facts and structure[^2][^8]          |
| Prime Minister                   | Appointed by President (usually the Lok Sabha majority leader)                | As long as majority support in Lok Sabha    | Government structure and role[^1][^7]           |
| Council of Ministers             | Appointed by President on PM’s advice                                         | As long as government has Lok Sabha confidence | Government structure[^1]                      |

The key idea is that citizens directly choose their Lok Sabha representatives, who in turn support a Prime Minister. The President, chosen by an electoral college, appoints the PM and gives recognition to laws and government actions.[^2][^1][^3]

## 8. Democracy in Action: Stories Kids Will Understand

Story 1: The Class Playground Rule (Lawmaking). Suppose the playground gets crowded and students argue over the use of the swings. The student council (Parliament) proposes a new rule: swings are for under-10s in the morning and for older students in the afternoon. Members debate, listen to suggestions, and add a “smart queue” to avoid pushing. Finally, they vote and the principal (President) recognizes the new rule. The head girl/boy (Prime Minister) and monitors (ministers) ensure everyone follows it and report back next week about how it works. This is like a bill becoming a law, with debate, amendment, assent, and implementation.[^2]

Story 2: The Captain Picks the Team (Government Formation). After a class election, the party with the most votes picks the head girl/boy (Prime Minister). The head girl/boy chooses monitors (ministers) who are good at different tasks—sports, science, art—so the class runs smoothly. This mirrors the President appointing the Prime Minister and the PM’s selection of ministers.[^1][^7]

Story 3: A Substitute Teacher When the Class Leader Is Busy (Ordinances). Sometimes Parliament is not in session and an urgent issue arises—like fixing broken taps in the washrooms. The principal (President), on the advice of the head girl/boy (PM), issues a temporary rule (ordinance) so the problem can be fixed right away. When the student council meets again, they discuss whether to make the temporary rule a permanent law. Ordinances allow urgent action between sessions.[^1][^2]

Story 4: Money for the School Fair (Money Bills). The class plans a fair and needs a budget. The student council debates how to raise funds (cake sale, art stall) and how to spend them (decorations, prizes). The head girl/boy brings the plan to the principal for approval. If the two houses (councils) disagree, the bigger class meeting (Lok Sabha) has the final say on money. Then everyone implements the plan and reports on what worked best. This shows why money bills emphasize the Lok Sabha’s decisive role.[^2]

Key facts to emphasise:
- The President is elected by an electoral college using proportional representation with a single transferable vote (PR-STV), serving a five-year term and eligible for re-election.[^3]
- Lok Sabha MPs are elected directly by the people; Rajya Sabha members are elected indirectly by state assemblies, with 12 nominated by the President.[^2][^8]
- Lok Sabha terms are five years; Rajya Sabha is a continuing house with one-third retiring every two years.[^2]
- Money bills: the Lok Sabha’s will prevails.[^2]
- Ordinances: the President can promulgate ordinances when Parliament is not in session, on the advice of the government, which must be laid before Parliament when it reconvenes.[^1]
- Special powers: Parliament can impeach the President, remove judges and key officers, and initiate constitutional amendments.[^2]

Discussion prompts:
- Why does the Lok Sabha have a special role in money bills?  
- How do checks and balances protect students in the “school of India”?  
- When should urgent temporary rules (ordinances) be used, and when should permanent laws be preferred?

Extension activities:
- A class mock Parliament: draft a simple bill (e.g., library rules), debate it, vote, and ask the “principal” to give assent.  
- Visit a local civic office or invite an elected representative for a student Q&A.  
- Compare India’s system to a school’s student council and explain similarities.

Notes on information gaps:
- This guide focuses on Union-level institutions; it does not cover state governments or the judiciary in detail.  
- Membership numbers change over time; the guide uses constitutional maximums and established features rather than the latest election-specific numbers.  
- Images are not included.
