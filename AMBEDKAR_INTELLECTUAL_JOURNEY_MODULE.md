### 🔍 **"Annihilation of Caste" (1936) → Articles 14-18 (Right to Equality)**

## 🎭 Story Format: "The Scholar Who Became the Architect"

**Chapter 1: The Young Scholar's Questions (1910s)**
Young Bhimrao Ambedkar sits in the Columbia University library, reading about different constitutions. Having experienced discrimination firsthand, he wonders: "How can a constitution ensure that no child faces what I faced? How can law create true equality?"

**Chapter 2: The Writer's Crusade (1920s-1930s)**
Dr. Ambedkar, now an accomplished lawyer and scholar, writes "Annihilation of Caste." Each word he writes becomes a building block for future constitutional provisions. "Caste is not a division of labor, but a division of laborers," he writes, unknowingly drafting what would become Article 15.

**Chapter 3: The Architect's Vision (1946-1950)**
In the Constituent Assembly, Chairman Ambedkar doesn't just draft articles—he translates his life's intellectual journey into constitutional language. Every provision reflects years of study, writing, and philosophical growth. His earlier writings become the foundation of India's constitutional framework.

**Chapter 4: The Legacy Lives On (1950-Today)**
When Indians today approach the Supreme Court for justice, when Dalit students get reservations in education, when minorities establish their own schools—they're benefiting from ideas that Ambedkar first explored in his academic writings decades earlier.
